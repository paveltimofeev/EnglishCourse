title: 8.2.6 The Negotiations. Question-word clauses
visible: 'yes'
---

##### A question-word clause usually has one of the following forms:

**QUESTION WORD + _SUBJECT_ + VERB.** <br>
**WHAT/WHO + VERB.**

- _**Who IS** the manager?_  -> QUESTION
- _I don't know **who** the manager **IS**_  -> QUESTION-WORD CLAUSE

##### Example:  
  - His story was ineresting.
  - **What he said** was ineresting.

  - I don't know the teacher.
  - I don't know **who _she_ is**.
  - I don't know **who _the teacher_ is**.
  
  - Devon: What are Mark's salary requirements?
  - Devon wants to know **what** Mark's salary requirements **are**.        

When question words are used to form question-word clauses, **"do", "does"** and **"did"** auxiliary verbs **do not follow the question words** 

- _Why **did** they buy it?_            
- _Nobody knows **why they BOUGHT it**._
