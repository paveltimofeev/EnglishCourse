title: 8.2.6 The Negotiations. Question-word clauses
visible: 'yes'
---

##### A question-word clause usually has one of the following forms:
  - QUESTION WORD + _SUBJECT_ + VERB.
  - WHAT/WHO + VERB.

***

##### Example:  
  - His story was ineresting.
  - **What he said** was ineresting.
  - I don't know the teacher.
  - I don't know **who _she_ is**.
  - I don't know **who _the manager_ is**.
    - who IS the manager?  -> QUESTION
    - who the manager IS?  -> QUESTION-WORD CLAUSE
  - Why **did** they buy it?              -> QUESTION
  - Nobody knows **why they BOUGHT it**.  -> QUESTION-WORD CLAUSE
        

When question words are used to form question-word clauses, "do," "does," and "did" auxiliary verbs do not follow the question words.

  - Devon: What are Mark's salary requirements?
  - Devon wants to know **WHAT** Mark's salary requirements **ARE**.
